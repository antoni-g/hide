    <p>Welcome to a new way to play Hide and Seek!  Choose whether you are going
    to be a hider or seeker.
    Hiders are able to locate other hiders as black dots on a radar,
    and seekers are blue dots.  Since the radar refreshes only every few
    seconds, be sure to move quickly!

    Seekers are able to locate the closest hider with a distance meter.
    They don't have a radar!

    Once a hider is caught, simply leave the webapp.</p>
